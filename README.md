### Find existing ways to access data and transfer data across HMRC

If you want to move data from one point to another, you can check if there’s an existing way to access and transfer data across HMRC.

By reusing what’s already available, you don’t need to build a single use solution which saves you time and money.

There are two ways you can securely access and transfer data across HMRC.

1.  APIs
2.  File transfer flows

APIs let IT systems and applications talk to each other and share data in real time.

File transfer flows transfer batch files or sets of data from A to B. Unlike an API, a file transfer flow only moves data from one place to another.

Each file transfer flow uses a specific file transfer pattern. You can reuse existing file transfer patterns to build your own file transfer flow to get data for your service.
