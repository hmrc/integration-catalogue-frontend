        The API Platform running in the MDTP Platform has about 100 APIs. These expose over 500 different endpoints. They
        are consumed by third party software developers as well as other government departments (OGDs).
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body" id="page-content">
        We are continually onboarding new APIs onto the platform, as well as updating existing APIs with new versions and
        functionality. Typically there are many releases of different APIs per week. It would be very hard to manually
        publish these changes to the API catalogue and make sure it is up-to-date.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body" id="page-content">
        So automation was added to the API platform. When a new version of an API is released onto the API platform it
        automatically updates the entry in the API catalogue - so that is always up to date!</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="page-heading">So what does this mean?</h2>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="page-heading">How does it technically work?</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body" id="page-content">
        The API Platform has a CI/CD pipeline as a Jenkins job. As part of this process, it converts the APIs RAML to an
        OpenAPI specification (Swagger) definition file and publishes it into the API catalogue via the publish API
        (documented <a id="homepage-link-3" href="/guides/api-catalogue-publish-guide" class="govuk-link">here</a>).
